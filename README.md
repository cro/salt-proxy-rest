salt-proxy-rest
===============

Simple REST endpoint with which to test the Salt Proxy Minion

Requires Requests and Bottle to be installed (`pip install bottle requests`).

Running `rest.py` will start a simple webserver at http://localhost:8080.  You
can hit that server with a browser to get a page that simulates the
status of a server.
